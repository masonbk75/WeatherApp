# WeatherApp
This app was completed for a preliminary interview screening. It is architected with the FlowController pattern and 
consists of a welcome screen for first time users, a weather details screen, and a search screen that displays search results
and keeps track of your search history. All weather data, including icons, are supplied by the openweathermap.org APIs.
